So that we can accommodate new supplier needs into our codebase

## My approach
* To refactor this mess. I first decided to write tests to make sure the functionalities work as expected before making any major changes and refactor the codebase.
* Once all tests pass, it is time to refactor (without adding new functionalities)
* Then, the new ```conjured items``` functionality must be tested and, finally, implemented.
