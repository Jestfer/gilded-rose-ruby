## My approach
* To refactor this mess. I first decided to write tests to make sure the functionalities work as expected before making any major changes and refactor the codebase.
* Once all tests pass, I separated models into two different files (item and gilded_rose), to keep things cleaner and to create private methods in the GildedRose class.
* Time to refactor (without adding new functionalities).
* Then, it was time to abstract some of these private methods into new objects (classes) that inherit from the common one (Item).
* Then, the new ```conjured items``` functionality must be tested and, finally, implemented.
